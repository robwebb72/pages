Sharing Data with Host Works like VM \u201cshared folders\u201d docker run -ti -v /home/user/folder:/shared-folder ubuntu bash /home/user/folder is the file path on the host /shared-folder is the path in the container This can also be done with files -v /home/user/readme.txt:/readme.txt Note: the file must exist before the container is run, otherwise its assumed to be a folder. Sharing between containers Start up first container with: docker run -v /shared-data \u2026. \u2014name my-container ( -v /shared-data means that the folder only exists in the container) Start up the other container: docker run \u2014volumes-from my-container \u2026 Now both containers have a /shared-data folder shared between them. /shared-data exists as long as ONE container is sharing it. Docker registries Registries manage and distribue images The docker company offers these for free Can also run your own docker search <name> - search for image (or use hub.docker.com) docker login -> log in to docker hub, creates token on local machine docker pull debian:sid docker tag debian:sid my-docker-id/new-image-name:v23 docker push my-docker-id/new-image-name:v23 Things to be aware of with registries DON\u2019T push images containing passwords Clean up your images regularly Be aware of how much you are trusting containers that you fetch Connecting Containers Legacy Linking Set environment variables inside linking container for host and port -> old (legacy) system IP address Binding Services that listen \u2018locally\u2019 by default are only available in the container. To allow connections, you need to use the \u2018bind address 0.0.0.0\u2019 inside the container. Use docker to limit access to the host only, e.g. docker run -p 127.0.0.1:1234:1234/tcp 127.0.0.1 -> only from the host Private Container Network Can group containers into 'private' networks. Can explicitly chose who can connect to who. Done by exposing ports and linking containers - docker helps you find other exposed ports with Compose services Exposing Ports can be done inside and outside the container docker run -p outside(host):inside(container) e.g. docker run -p 40000:50000 -p 40001:50001 ubuntu:14.04 ports 40000 and 40001 are on the host (outside) ports 50000 and 50001 are in the container (inside) Exposing Ports Dynamically Example docker run -port 50000 -port 50001 --name echo-server ubuntu:14.04 ports 50000 and 50001 are inside the container. To find the host ports mapped to these, use:- docker port echo-server This should produce an output like:- 50000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32770 50001/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32771 Allows many containers running fixed ports - no need to worry about conflicts - often used with a service discovery program. UDP Ports docker run -p 12345:12345/udp Can also specify /tcp, but tcp is the default anyway. Connecting between containers Linking Directly generally used with orchestration links all ports but only one way only for services that cannot be run on different machines e.g. a service and health check that monitors it services and its db? Probably NOT a good idea e.g. docker run --rm -ti --link [server] --link [server] - [server] is the name of the container to link to. Can then use this name to connect to server inside docker Dynamic Linking Docker has private networks private networks have built in name servers that fix links MUST create the networks in advance docker network create <network name> This allows the link to be broken and recreated - e.g. if a server container is stopped, it can then be restarted and the namespace server with recreate the link.

Entity classes do not have to derive from a specific base class - this means they can inherit from any object you want. All classes created using the Linq2SQL designer are partial classes - can optionally add additional properties, methods or events to them. Renaming Within the LINQ2SQL Designer surface you can rename entities, properties and associations. Relaionships & Associations The above association causes the following:- the Product entity has a \"Cateogry\" property the Category entty has a \"Products\" collection Delayed/Lazy Loading Can specify whether properties on entities are delay loaded (e.g. in the example above we are delay loading an image). This will only load the image when it is acutally being used, rather than in a simple query that is returning all the CategoryNames. Stored Procedures Can drag and drop SPROCs onto an entity in the LINQ2SQL designer surface where appropriate, for strong type linking (this isn't possible in all cases) . For example, with a stroed proc that returns a list of Products, drag the proc onto the Products table to create a return type of IEnumerable\\ . Stored Procs for Updating/Inserting and Deleting Can change the update/insert/delete methods on an entity to use a stored proc. This is done at the mapping layer of LINQ2SQL. This means that developers do not have to change their code even if an optimised sproc is later put in place.","title":"Learning from ScottGu's Linq Blog \ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#learning-from-scottgus-linq-blog","text":"","title":"Learning from ScottGu's Linq Blog \ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#blog-1","text":"","title":"Blog 1"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#the-data-context","text":"This class is the main conduit by which we query entities from the database and apply changes back to it.","title":"The Data Context"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#server-side-paging","text":"NorthWindDataContext dc= new NorthWindDataContext(); var products = (from p in dc.Products where p.Category.CategoryName.StartsWith(\"C\") select p).Skip(200).Take(10); Skip(200) starting with row 200 Take(10) only take the first 10 rows","title":"Server Side Paging"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#blog-2","text":"","title":"Blog 2"},{"location":"software-dev/languages/c%23/linq/Scott%27s%20Linq%20Blog.html#entity-classes","text":"Entity Classes map to tables within the database.

There is no guarantee about how much space is set aside - it's dependent on the compiler. This can be an issue in threading... all bitfields must be read to and written to at the same time. Enum Enums in C++ are essentially a collection of constants. enum card_suit : **uint8_t** { SPADE, HEART, DIAMOND, CLUB}; enum card_rank {ACE = 1, JACK = 11, QUEEN, KING }; Can specify the size of the enum (e.g. uint8_t in the above) instead of the default of int . Can specify the value of the enum, (e.g. ACE =1 , JACK =11 ) and after that the count continues (so QUEEN will be 12 and KING will be 13) struct Card { int rank; int suit; } Card deck[52] = { {ACE, SPADE}, {2, SPADE}, \u2026. } Union Using the same memory space for different types. e.g. union ipv4 { uint32_t i32; struct { uint8_t a; uint8_t b; uint8_t c; uint8_t d; } octets; } union ipv4 hos; host.octets = {192, 168, 0, 1}; Typedefs, Autotype and Nullptr typedef unsigned char points_t; points_t is an alias for unsigned char . It\u2019s common to add _t to indicate it\u2019s a typedef . autotype (C++11 onwards) auto x= func(); Works like C# var - can use it in place of complicated definitions (e.g. instead of vector<int>::iterator ) nullptr (C++11 onwards) A pointer of 0 that can be used for any pointer (and only pointers) Operators += -= *= /= %= ++j j++ (prefix is slightly more optimised than postfix) Logical operators && || !

Local variables are stored on the stack. It\u2019s a good idea not to declare large objects as locals. Static variables are only initialised once (further calls to an initialiser do not update the value) const string & func() { const static string s= \u201cHello World!\u201d; return s; } const string s = func(); Function Pointers void func() { \u2026 } void (*pfunc)() = func; // declares a function pointer pfunc(); // calls func() - also (*pfunc)(); is allowable - this is the C version Use - Jumptable.. void fa() {\u2026} void fb() {\u2026} void fc() {\u2026} void (*funcs[])() = { fa, fb, fc } funcs[1](); // calls fb - this is useful for menu options, etc. Finding the size of an array\u2026 int array_size = sizeof(funcs) / sizeof(funcs[0]); Variable number of parameters #include <cstdarg> double average(const int count, \u2026) { va_list ap; double total = 0.0; **va_start**(ap, count); // va_start needs a matching va_end for(int i=0; i<count; ++i) { total += va_arg(ap, double); // double is the type in this context } **va_end**(ap); // va_end needs a matching va_start return total / count; } #include <cstdarg> int message(const char *fmt, \u2026) { va_list ap; va_start(ap, fmt); int rc = vfprintf(stdout, **fmt, ap**); // passing a va list to another function puts(\u201c\u201d); va_end(ap); return rc; } Alternatively... char buffer[2048]; va_list ap; va_start(ap, fmt); vsprintf(buffer,fmt,ap); va_end(ap); Objects & Classes class Class1 { int i; // private section (could have private on line above) public: Class1(); // ctor -> constructor ~Class1(); // dtor -> destructor } The class is essentially a struct with methods. Can replace a struct with a class and the code will still work. Only different is the default access modifier. item default access struct public class private Considered best practice to separate implementation of methods (in a .cpp file) from interface (in a .h file) Const Classes When a class is declared as const, it needs const safe methods... const C1 o1; o1.getValue(); This will need the following function\u2026 int C1::getValue() const; // cannot change C1\u2019s members in this function This is considered different to the (mutable) function\u2026 int C1::getValue(); The compiler will call the relevant function depending on if the object is defined as a const or mutable. This is a form of overloading. If you have a function in a class that doesn\u2019t change member values in the object, it\u2019s best to always declare it as const safe. Constructors and Deconstructors class Animal { string _Type = \"\"; string _Name = \"\"; public: Animal(); // default constructor Animal(const string &type, const string &name); Animal(const Animal &); // copy constructor (called by assignment, e.g. Animal b = a; ) ~Animal(); } Animal::Animal(const string & type, const string & name): _Type(type), _Name(name) {}; Operator Overloading - with Member Functions** class Rational { int _n; int _d; public: Rational(int num = 0, int den = 1): _n(num), _d(den) {}; // compiler will use this to convert an int to a Rational Rational(const Rational &rhs): _n(rhs._n), _d(rhs._d) {}; // copy constructor Rational & operator = (const Rational &); // not const safe, assignment changes member values Rational operator + (const Rational &) const; // this is const safe as it returns the result of the operation, doesn\u2019t change \"this\" } Rational & Rational::operator = (const Rational &rhs) { if (this!=rhs) { _n = rhs._n; _d = rhs._d; } return * this; // we return a reference to \u201cthis\u201d - allows chaining of assignments: x = y = z; } Rational Rational::operator + (const Rational &rhs) { // returns a new object - can\u2019t return a ref to a temp (stack based) object return Rational(_n * rhs._d + _d * rhs._n, _d * rhs._d); // the new object is destroyed after the overloaded operator is evaluated } Operator Overloading - without Member Functions Non member function overloading is useful for when the LHS of an expression is not the type of your class. e.g. Rational = int + Rational <- we haven\u2019t got an overloaded + operator for int -> Rational Rational operator + (const Rational &lhs, const Rational &rhs) { return Rational(lhs.numerator() * rhs.denominator() + lhs.denominator() * rhs.numerator(), lhs.denominator() * rhs.numerator() ); } This is defined outside of the scope of the class. Now when Rational = int + Rational is called, the compile will use the implicit constructor to convert the int to a Rational and then call the + operator overload. Note that this method (as it is outside of the class cannot access the private members of the class). Overloading the c.out << operator std::ostream & operator << (std::stream &o, const Rational &r) { if(r.denominator()==1) return o << r.numerator(); else return o << r.numerator() << \u201c/\u201c << r.denominator(); } Templates Template specialisation -> done at compile time for each set of data types. Caveats - larger executables, longer compile times, confusing error messages Template Functions** template<typename T> // <typename T> is the template argument list T maxof(T a, T b) { return (a>b) ? a : b; } int m = maxof<int>(7, 9); Cannot define a template within a block. Type safe as the compiler does the substitution at compile time (so if a type that doesn\u2019t have a > operator is used, the compiler will complain).

It's a Lisp convention that these are used to identify global variables. The asterixes are part of the name. defvar and defparameter defvar will only set a value once. If defvar is used to change a variable's value again, the value will not change. The value can be changed with calls to other functions (such as defparameter ). e.g. [1]> (defvar +hello+ \"Hello\") ; define the value +HELLO+ [2]> +hello+ \"Hello\" [3]> (defvar +hello+ \"Hello World\") ; defvar won't change value +HELLO+ [4]> +hello+ \"Hello\" [5]> (defparameter +hello+ \"Hello World\") ; defparameter WILL change the value +HELLO+ [6]> +hello+ \"Hello World\" see also: setf and setq Defining a Function (defun func_name (arguments) ... body ... ) Defining Local Variables (let (variable declarations) ..body... ) Defining Local Functions There are two ways to define a local function in Lisp flet and labels . flet functions can only be called by the body labels allows local functions to call themselves and other local functions.

Typically a JAR or a POM . Transitive Dependency If your project needs artifact A and artifact A needs artifact B , transitively your project need artifact B . These transitive dependencies can be many layers deep, but they cannot be cyclic. Dependency Managament Allows project authors to specify the version of the artifact they need. Dependency Mediation Determines the version of an artifact to use when multiple versions are encountered. e.g. project --> A --> D (v2.0) | +---> B --> D (v1.5) In this case D (v2.0) would be used as it is the nearest definition in the dependency tree. This can lead to confusing situations, but most of the time it works. Usually gets the latest version but not all the time. Dependency Exclusion Can exlude certain dependencies. Optional Dependencies Can mark dependencies as optional, so they aren't used downstream. Dependency Scope Compile - available on all classpaths, propogates to downstream projects. (this dependency is include when your project is included as another project's dependency) Provided - like Compile but expected to be provided by JDK/container at runtime. Runtime - not required for compilation, but needed at runtime (eg. data access for a database) Test - on available on test classpath.

Lifecycle Plugins maven-clean-plugin one goal - clean remove files generated during build process by default removes /target directory from project root and submodule root folders Can add the clean cycle to another lifecycle by adding the following within the project tag e.g. This runs the clean:clean plugin goal as part of the initialize phase. <project> ... <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.1.0</version> <!-- can omit the version number - it will be inherited, but will generate a warning that it's missing --> <executions> <execution> <id>auto-clean</id> <phase>initialize</phase> <goals> <goal>clean</goal> </goals> </execution> </plugin> </plugins> </build> ... </project> Common practice: By hooking the clean plugin into specific phases (like initialize), it can save you from having to type in clean on the command line, e.g. Instead of mvn clean package , you can now use mvn package Instead of mvn clean install , you can now use mvn install Effectively this is adding the clean plugin goal into the default lifecycle. maven-compiler-plugin in Default Lifecycle two goals - compiler:compile, compiler:testCompile (and a compiler:help goal) by default, uses the compiler 'javax.tools.JavaCompiler' - can be configured to use javac default source and target language levels are Java 1.6, apache encourages these values to be set Can change the compiler version in the POM.xml file. <properties> ... <java.version>11</java.version> <!-- The following two lines might also be required --> <maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target> ... </properties> This will compile to java version 11 - changing this (e.g. to 1.6) will compile the code to a different version. Resources Plugin https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/ in Default Lifecycle 3 goals - resources:resources, resources:testResources, resources:copy-resources purpose is to copy project resources to output directory (target dir) Resources normally live in src -> main -> resources and src -> test -> resources resources:resources copies files in resources into target/classes ready to be packaged into a jar. Can add an external resource directory by adding the following to POM.xml <project> ... <build> <resources> <resource> <directory>[your files here]</directory> </resource> </resources> </build> ... </project> This overrides the default resources directory, but you can add multiple resources <resources> <resource> <directory>resource1</directory> </resource> <resource> <directory>resource2</directory> </resource> <resource> <directory>resource3</directory> </resource> </resources> Other things this plugin can be configured for is: specifying a character encoding scheme filtering including and excluding files/folders Surefire Plugin in Default Lifecycle one goal: surefire:test (also surefire:help) by default supports: JUnit3, JUnit4, JUnit5 and TestNG by default includes classes named: Test , Test, Tests, TestCase (can change these) also handles POJO tests Runs tests out of your test directory.
